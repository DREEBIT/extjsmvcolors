"Ext Js MVColors" plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

Ext Js MVColors eases the work with Ext Js files by labeling tabs of open MVC files
from their actual content (the defined namespace or alias). 
Additional, specific file icons and tab background colors are set for 
model (red), view (green) and controller (yellow) files.
