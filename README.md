Ext Js MVColors plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
=========================================

Ext Js MVColors eases the work with Ext Js files by labeling tabs of open MVC files from their actual content (the defined @title, last folder and filename, namespace or alias). Additional specific file icons and tab background colors are set for model (red), view (green), controller (yellow) and store (blue) files.
